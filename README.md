# Loan_Prediction

This is one of the classic machine Learning classification problem where the goal is to predict whether to give loan to a customer or not based on some of the data created by respective company. 

### Data can be downloaded from Kaggle at: <br/>

<b> Data Files: </b> <br/>
  <t> <i> 1) train.csv : Training data </i></t> <br/>
  <t> <i> 2) test.csv: Test data </i></t> <br/>

<br/>
<b> The steps for creating a model are described below: </b> <i>
  
  a) Load the data from file <br/>
  b) Exploratory Data Analysis <br/>
  c) Handling missing values and dropping irrelavant columns (noise) <br/>
  d) Label Encode and OneHotEncode Columns which contains categories <br/>
  e) Data is ready to inserted into a ML model <br/>
  f) Create a baseline model (i.e. Logistic Regression) to baseline performance <br/>
  g) Use other ML models like (Decision Tree, Random Forest Tree, K-NN, SVM etc) <br/>
  h) Create Confusion matrix for all classifiers, compare the results and see which classifier performed better. </i>

<b> NOTE</b>: <br/>
For this project, I have used publicaly available dataset from Kaggle to learn Machine Learning, Deep Learning and NLP methodologies for personal growth.
